Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?

I got my first computer when I was in Grade 4. It was a Pentium 4 with less than 2 GB of ram. Until then, whenever I needed find something out, whether it was for homework or just to feed my own curiosity, I'd look it up in this huge set of Encyclopedia that my deceased grandfather had left me. I was amazed when I found out how much information there was on the internet. I had an amazing tool at my hand, and I wanted it to do more. I wanted to control it. And that's when it all started.

I discovered Computer Science. The fact that I could solve any problem imaginable using a combination of only few intructions just blew me away. And even today, the vast field keeps inspirimg me to learn more.

But if there was one topic that fascinates me the most, it would be the study of machine learning. I could spend hours learning about Artificial Intelligence and how they work. I think my fascination is mostly due to how counter-intuitive it feels that a program can learn to solve a probem without being told how to, much like a living being. With today's technology, these simple programs can solve huge problems faster and better than humans. Not just that, they have even started to tackle fields like art and music. 

Often I spend my time watching YouTube tutorials from channels like Siraj Rawal and carykh and try to replicate what they have made. And even if I fail, I know I will have learnt something new. Other times I would read books and guides to create something original.
